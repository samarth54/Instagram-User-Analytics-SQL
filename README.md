# üìò Instagram User Analytics ‚Äì SQL Project

## üìç Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Instagram user data using **SQL** to derive meaningful insights that support business decisions. As a data analyst working with the product team at Instagram, your goal is to explore user interactions and engagement patterns to help improve marketing strategies, detect inactive or bot users, and evaluate overall platform usage.

The analysis answers several real-world business questions related to marketing, product insights, and investor metrics using **MySQL Workbench**.

## üéØ Objectives

The project is divided into two segments:

### A) Marketing Analysis
- Identify the most loyal (longest active) users.
- Find inactive users who have never posted.
- Determine the contest winner (most liked photo).
- Discover the top 5 most popular hashtags.
- Recommend the best day to launch an ad campaign based on user sign-ups.

### B) Investor Metrics
- Evaluate user engagement by calculating average posts per user.
- Detect potential bots or fake accounts based on unusual activity (e.g., liking every photo).
