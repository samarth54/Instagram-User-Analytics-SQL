# üìò Instagram User Analytics ‚Äì SQL Project

## üìç Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of skill development in SQL and data analysis. It involves exploring Instagram user data to extract actionable insights related to user engagement and behavior. Through this analysis, the project demonstrates the ability to write complex SQL queries to answer practical business questions in marketing, product management, and investor relations.

The work simulates real-world data challenges and uses MySQL Workbench to manipulate and analyze relational datasets effectively.

## üéØ Objectives

The project is divided into two segments:

### A) Marketing Analysis
- Identify the most loyal (longest active) users.
- Find inactive users who have never posted.
- Determine the contest winner (most liked photo).
- Discover the top 5 most popular hashtags.
- Recommend the best day to launch an ad campaign based on user sign-ups.

### B) Investor Metrics
- Evaluate user engagement by calculating average posts per user.
- Detect potential bots or fake accounts based on unusual activity (e.g., liking every photo).

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Setup Instructions

Before running the SQL queries, you need to create the database schema and load the sample data. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.

2. Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your MySQL server instance.

3. Locate the SQL script file named `database_initialize.sql` in the sql_scripts folder.

4. Open the `database_initialize.sql` file in MySQL Workbench.

5. **Execute** the script by clicking the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button (‚ö°Ô∏è). This will:

   - Create the necessary database and tables (`users`, `photos`, `likes`, `tags`, `photo_tags`)
   - Insert sample data into each table for the project analysis.

6. Once the script completes successfully, your database will be ready for running the query scripts located in the `sql_scripts` folder.

## üöÄ How to Run the SQL Scripts

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your database.
3. Open any `.sql` file from the `sql_scripts` folder.
4. Execute the query to see the results.
